 * @brief Interface for discret distribution objects.
 *
 * A discrete distribution usually contains a finite set of
 * categories and a probability associated to each.
 * 
 * Each category (or class) is defined by two bounds, and sometimes by
 * a mean or a median value.
 *
 * A discrete distribution may contain one or several parameters.
 * The probabilities associated to each class usually depends on
 * the parameter values.
 * In some cases, the number and/or bounds of the classes may also 
 * depend on the parameters values, depending on the kind of
 * discretization used.

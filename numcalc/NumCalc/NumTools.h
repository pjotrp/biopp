/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * @par
 * This library provides interfaces, classes and functions for numerical calculus.
 * The tools included are general enough to be useful beyond biology.
 * The originality of the library, unless many existing libraries, is to be fully
 * object-oriented. It is also fully compatible with the other Bio++ libraries, and uses
 * the core-classes of the BppUtils library.
 *
 * @par
 * Available methods include:
 * - Vector operations, based on the stl::vector class, see bpp::VectorTools,
 * - Matrix data and operations, see the bpp::Matrix interface and bpp::MatrixTools class,
 * - Functions are implemented using several general classes:
 *   - the bpp::Function interface and its derivatives,
 *   - the bpp::Parameter, bpp::Constraint and bpp::ParameterList classes, and the bpp::Parametrizable interface
 *     provide a very general way to deal with parameters
 * - Function opterations, see the bpp::Optimizer interface, and the bpp::AbstractNumericalDerivative class for
 *   numerical differenciation,
 * - Discrete probability distributions are implemented via the bpp::DiscreteDistribution interface
 * - Several random numbers generators are available through the bpp::RandomNumberFactory interface, and the
 *   bpp::RandomTools static class provides useful methods to deal with random numbers.
